This project allows for a quick and cheap (if you already have the laser) project to teach a little bit of circuit making, no soldering required.

It is inspired by Jakob Schaeffer's design. Champaign Urbana Community Fab Lab and the Wagner Family Fab Lab held a skill share and we loved Jake's LED activity, so we made our own.

You can send the PDF directly to a laser cutter. 

The .svg was created (and is most easily edited) in Inkscape.
The schematic PDF is not a cut file, just meant to be informative.

A color layer is provided if you have colorful cardstock to stack on top of the cardboard.
